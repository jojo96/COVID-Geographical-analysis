A geographical analysis of COVID-19 using Folium library 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

The current work uses the folium library to analyse the worldwide spread of COVID-19 during the first half of 2020.
